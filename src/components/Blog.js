        Building a Conversational AI App with .NET, React, and ChatGPT
      </h1>
      <p>
        Intro:
        <br />
        Conversational AI has been a hot topic in the tech industry for several
        years now. With the increasing demand for chatbots and virtual
        assistants, building a conversational AI app has become a must for
        businesses of all sizes. In this blog post, we'll explore how to build a
        conversational AI app using .NET, React, and ChatGPT.
      </p>
      <h2 className="text-xl font-bold my-4">Introduction to .NET and React</h2>
      <p>
        .NET is a free, open-source development platform created by Microsoft.
        It is used to build a variety of applications, including web, mobile,
        and desktop apps. React is a JavaScript library for building user
        interfaces, developed by Facebook. React is widely used in modern web
        development because of its simplicity and scalability.
      </p>
      <h2 className="text-xl font-bold my-4">Introduction to ChatGPT</h2>
      <p>
        ChatGPT is a large language model developed by OpenAI. It is based on
        the GPT-3 architecture and is designed to generate human-like responses
        to natural language inputs. ChatGPT is a powerful tool for building
        conversational AI apps because it can understand natural language inputs
        and generate responses that sound like they were written by a human.

      </h2>
      <li>Create a new React project</li>
<pre className="bg-gray-100 p-4 rounded-lg my-4">
  <code className="text-sm font-mono">
    npx create-react-app chat-gpt-app
  </code>
</pre>
<p className="mb-4">
  This will create a new React project called "chat-gpt-app" in your current directory. Once the project is created, navigate to the project directory using:
</p>
<pre className="bg-gray-100 p-4 rounded-lg my-4">
  <code className="text-sm font-mono">
    cd chat-gpt-app
  </code>
</pre>
<p className="mb-4">
  Next, you'll need to install the "axios" package, which will be used to make HTTP requests to your .NET back-end API:
</p>
<pre className="bg-gray-100 p-4 rounded-lg my-4">
  <code className="text-sm font-mono">
    npm install axios
  </code>
</pre>
<h2>Use the ChatGPT API to send natural language inputs to the model and receive responses</h2>
      <pre className="bg-gray-100 p-4 rounded-lg my-4">
        <code className="block">{`// Paste the JavaScript code block for using the ChatGPT API here`}</code>
      </pre> 
      <h2>Step 4: Use .NET to create a back-end API</h2>
      <pre className="bg-gray-100 p-4 rounded-lg my-4">
        <code className="block">{`// Paste the C# code block for creating a back-end API here`}</code>
      </pre>
